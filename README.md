For **Kodi Matrix** use the branch `master` (default branch).

For **Kodi Leia** use the branch `Leia` (default branch).

For **Kodi Krypton** use the branch `Krypton`.

## Installing the skin ##

It is important that you follow this instructions.

  1) In this page click on the green button `Clone or Download` --> `Download ZIP`.

  2) Uncompress this ZIP file. This will create a directory named `skin.estuary.AEL-$branch_name$`, where `$branch_name$` could be `master`, `Leia`, etc.

  3) Rename that directory to `skin.estuary.AEL`. Remove the trailing `-$branch_name$` from the directory name.

  4) Compress that directory again into a ZIP file. The name of the ZIP file should be `skin.estuary.AEL.zip`.

  5) In Kodi, use that ZIP file (and not the original one) to install the skin. To install the skin using the ZIP file, in the Home window click on **Add-ons**. In the Add-ons window select and click on the top icon of an open box. Finally, select **Install from zip file**.

     To change the skin, in the Home window go to **Settings**, then select **Interface**, then in the **Skin** tab select **Skin** and select `Estuary AEL mod`.

     Note that if you use a different skin from the default Estuary the location of certain menus could be a bit different.

  6) If `Estuary AEL mod` doesn't show up in the skin list the reason could be that the skin is disabled. In the **Home** window go to **Add-ons**, there select the option **My add-ons**, then click on **All**. In the list of all the add-ons you have installed search and select `Estuary AEL mod`. Press `C` to open the context menu and select `Information`. In the information window you can check wheter the skin is enabled. If the skin is not enabled click on the **Enable** button.

  7) Done!
